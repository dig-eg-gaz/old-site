Anytime you learn something new, there are problems to come along with it. To try new things and learn new things you will have to face a little bit of adversity. This semester in Digital Microhistory I learned basically a whole new language by learning xml and some coding. This task definitely came with its challenges.

One of the most prominent issues that arose was learning the xml language itself. Marking text with “div” tags and all the others was very confusing and sometimes tedious. It seemed that every time I added a tag or edited something, the program oxygen would add another error to my document. The right side of my document was filled with red indicating I had multiple errors. Eventually I learned how to fix them and completely it the right way. Although some errors were fixed by miracle.

Another issue that I had was taking the actual pictures of the microfilm in the basement of strozier. The quality of the microfilm was short or awesome and made it harder for me to take a clear picture no matter what attributes I changed on the picture. This difficulty just made the process longer and more time consuming. One thing that would’ve made the process a whole lot easier was if the OCR program would have scanned the microfilm more accurately, reducing the amount of time spent having to edit the text afterwards. Overall through the challenges I learned a lot of new skills that will be useful in the future.

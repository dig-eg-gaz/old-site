The one topic throughout this whole newspaper that consistently grabbed my
attention and amazed me time and time again was the unbelievable stories
of medical miracles happening.  The feature that really caught my attention was
from Doan's Backache Kidney Pills apparently saving a man from being bed ridden
his whole life.  This claim was so shocking to me because I am familiar with this
brand, my dad takes it for his minor back pains he gets while at work or if he
over does it at the gym.  I was baffled to see this huge of a success story.
Were the ingredients of a higher potency?  Could medicine really have been this
advanced over a century ago? People were being cured from severe medical
ailments, by a box of pills from the drugstore.  Conditions confining them to
their beds and hindering them from work and everyday life, were suddenly gone.
My serial question is how successful really were these pills? I will be
researching how many cases of medical success resulted from the Doan's Backache
Kidney Pills in particular over the course of this year.  I will also go into
further studies of the proclaimed brand and gain more historical and background
knowledge of its origins and the pill's chemical makeup.  I hope to conclude
how successful of a brand this really was and determine if it was as miraculous
as the people of Egypt claim.

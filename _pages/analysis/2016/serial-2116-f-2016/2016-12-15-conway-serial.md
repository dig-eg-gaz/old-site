As long as the earth has been a round ball floating through space with people on it, people have used hashish and its many derivatives as medicine and so forth.  But more recently within the past 200 years, hashish has become genrally illegal everywhere and was especially illegal around the early 1900's.  In my serial question I am going to ask how many times there was a hashish seizure or mention in the Egyptian Gazette and see if I can piece together some kind of resembalance between the occurances.

The possible data points I could use are the amounts seized in each seizure, the locations of hashish related occurances, and what the occuranes entailed.  I have a feeling that there will be around 6 seizures mentioned in the newspaper and possibly more mentions of hashish in general.  I am very interested to see what this turns up as hashish is still around today being smuggled, and people being arrested for it so not really much has chained. I will include a graph or seizure amounts and map of happenings locations.

While reading the Egyptian Gazette, I have seen multiple topics concerning different imports and exports throughout Egypt. One import that was interest to me was coal. This was because in Egypt, coal was a resource that was primarily imported. There also seemed to be a great amount of use for coal in that time. I plan on doing this by searching for the word “coal” in each and every page and looking for instances where coal imports are being discussed. Then I plan on taking the numbers given to calculate how much coal was actually being imported through Egypt. By searching the word coal only, I should be able to get a return on as many results as possible.

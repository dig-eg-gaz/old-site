I have chosen murder as my topic of interest because I am interested in the way murders occurred during that time period. I wonder how often murders occurred and if there was some reoccurring theme. What kind of weapons were common? Was there an absurd or extreme murder? I plan to find the answers to these questions and try to find some pattern or similarity. If I don’t find anything in common, then that is fine because murders do not tend to have anything in common. I have been looking at the newspaper and some of the murders are multiple homicide and others occurred because of trivial things. This just comes to show how petty people people can be. To kill for such meaningless or insignificant reasons is a bit extreme. I plan on emphasizing how often murders occurred throughout the year but I will only be able to find them with the keyword murder. Therefore, I will not be able to catch all of the murders that either did not have the keyword or were not completed by my classmates. Although it should not affect me much because there are still plenty of results. I am not sure if I will be able to hit the 1500 word requirement but I will try my best.</p>

The process of digitizing The Egyptian Gazette took a considerable amount of time. Though the progress that was being made at the end of each step was just as rewarding. Digitizing The Egyptian Gazette included three processes.  
The first process was scanning taking photos the microfilm. Scanning the microfilm took a few short hours all together. But this was a small amount of time in relation to other taskâ€™s total time. At the end of scanning I was able to feel small sense of accomplishment once I was able to scroll through all of the photos that were scanned.  
The second process in digitizing The Egyptian Gazette was OCR scanning the text within the newspaper pages. This was not as glamorous as taking photos of the microfilm or XML coding the text. This was due to the length of time that it took. I may also have bias towards this because I have lost full pages of OCR text multiple times. Note to whoever may do this in the future: Save your progress often and save it to a computer rather than a flash drive. I have started over on this step several times due to my flash drive falling out of my computer. Needless to say, I was thanking the heavens when I finished all of my pages and they were completely saved.  
The last and most engaging process of digitizing The Egyptian Gazette was XML coding the plain text versions of the OCR text. I enjoyed this process the most, though it was not the shortest. Still, this step never felt long. I felt the most satisfied when finishing this because it meant that the page was completely converted into digital format.  
At the end of each part of the process, there was a considerable amount of progress made and I was able to see it. This, in turn, made completing this more enjoyable.

My serial question is stemming from a series of passages I read in my issue.
There seems to be a massacre of the Jewish population in Russia. I found this
to be interesting because this is decades prior to World War II, where there
was mass homicide of the Jews in Europe. I would like to explore how this built
up throughout the year and what reports are reaching Egypt. They are reporting
mass killings but seem to remain an objective third party.

People tend to say that history has a way of repeating itself. It interests
me that there was mass homicide of the Jewish population 30 years prior to the
most infamous (dare I say successful) murder of millions of Jews. I intend to
explore this topic and the history of conflict Europeans had with the Jewish
population.

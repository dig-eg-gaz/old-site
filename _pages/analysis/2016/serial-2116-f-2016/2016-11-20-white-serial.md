My current plan for the serial question is to make a map showcasing all of the nations and cities mentioned in the international news section of the Gazette's page 3,
over the course of the months of May to September 1905 (perhaps more if necessary). I believe this is an area where there's quite a bit to work with. You have the results themselves, plus the implications of said results.

Whatever the topic may be, each and every bit of information (besides the ads, of course) are in the paper for one reason and one reason alone. It was of interest to
the audience of the Gazette. I intend to analyze why exactly these particular cities and countries might have been of interest to the intended audience of the Gazette.
I would imagine that it's going to be mostly a mixture of economic interests, cultural 'homesickness', economic interests, and it's entirely possible that, please, just hear me out here, economic interests might have been involved.

In short, my paper is largely going to be around analyzing the reasons behind why particular nations and countries were mentioned more often than others, and perhaps
why some countries weren't mentioned at all.

## later
Here's a link to it just in case. It might not work as a standard xlsx file, I'm not sure, it's gone both ways, but just in case, here's the link. I did, in fact, do the work.

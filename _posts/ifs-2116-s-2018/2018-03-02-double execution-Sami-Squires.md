The *Egyptian Gazette* shows that **Double executions** took place in the early 1900s, especially for murder. In this short article, the two murderers jointly murdered Ibrahim Khalif and in return were hung four months later at the prison. Both men claimed they were wrongly convicted of the crime.  

The result for double execution showed up only within two articles of *The Egyptian Gazette* including on July 7, 1905 and within my issue in 1907.

The history of double executions has pretty much diminished in many nations. In Egypt, they still perform [hanging executions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Egypt), but since each convict has to go before a jury, double executions haven't taken place for awhile. In the U.S. Arkansas was the [last state to have performed a double execution](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/04/24/525385016/arkansas-prepares-for-first-double-execution-in-u-s-since-2000) which was a few hours apart and for different crimes. These "double executions" are different than what Alexandria would have done.

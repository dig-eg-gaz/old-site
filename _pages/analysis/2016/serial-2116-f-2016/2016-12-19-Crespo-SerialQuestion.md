The serial question I have kept in mind throughout our work with the Egyptian gazette what exactly are the Nile Gauge Readings and how do they fluctuate during the year. Every time anyone flips through the newspaper they are able to see this chart. The chart is big and catches everyoneâ€™s attention, therefore it caught mine. The chart does not explain what form of measurement they use to calculate the numbers provided, it just states the different places where they measure from. It totals up to eleven different measurements. Some of the measurements vary greatly from the others, which is crazy to me. This chart is meant to provide all the measurements for the whole month in the last issue of the month, but every week posts the readings for that particular week. The Nile Gauge Readings chart seems to be a complicated one, but I am very interested in discovering what exactly the measurements are and if there is a trend depending on the location throughout the year. Also the weather probably has a lot to do with the level in the water, so looking at the year as a whole I will be able to see in what season the levels are at their lowest and highest.

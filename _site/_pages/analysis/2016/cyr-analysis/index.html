					<h1>Bubonic Plague In Egypt, 1905</h1>
				</div>
			</header>


			

			<div itemprop="articleSection">
			<p>The goal of this final project was to focus and analyze instances of ‘disease’ found
within the pages of the Egyptian Gazette in the year 1905. Each student in the class
was allocated a week to  digitize the paper’s contents, so the the year’s contents
could then be searched and analyzed by each member of the class for their individualized
final projects. The results from the students’ collaborative efforts over time, and the
large volume of data obtained from these searches refocused the shape that the final
project would take. Instead of analyzing instances of ‘disease,’ a very broad spectrum, the focus then shifted
to the analysis of a more narrow and repetitive disease called the ‘Bubonic Plague’, or the ‘Plague.’</p>

<p>Before analyzing the results of the search, some hurdles had to to be overcome. For
instance, utilizing the editing platform oXygen and its search field xPath query was
difficult at first. Certain formulas needed to be understood and then used which also required
a consistency on those who contributed to the database. Fortunately, Dr. Will Hanley
paved the way for those utilizing these search features by presenting the actual search
feature formulas as well as explaining the use for each.</p>

<p>Some results in the search did contain
the word ‘plague,’ but sometimes the surrounding contents were not legible due to the issue with the OCR software.
The OCR was used to transmit the .jpg content to a .text format, but in most instances this software
did not work and required the user to type the information directly from the .jpg itself, in some
instances, the misinterpreted OCR results were simply not corrected.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/dig-eg-gaz/dig-eg-gaz.github.io/blob/master/images/analysis-images/cyr-DIVSearchTerm.png?raw=true" alt="Div Search Term" /></p>

<p>The most basic formula (shown above) was used in searching for instances
of Bubonic Plague. This search function essentially searches for any term that was housed
within a ‘div’ tag. There was some difficulty in using the most basic of search
functions in that the search yielded some results that were not exactly relevant to the specific
disease Bubonic Plague. Further, there were subtleties that were found (by accident)
in the search function. For instance, a search of plague (lowercase) yielded 115 results and
a search of the word Plague (uppercase) yielded 50 results. The uppercase version showed more
concrete information on the actual disease and most of the results had the word plague mentioned multiple times.
This also serves to show the power of the oXygen
editing platform and the xPath query function.</p>

<p>The next issue was to determine how to analyze the results that were found within a year’s worth
of information housed within the Egyptian Gazette newspaper (see pie-chart below). In addition to the contents of the Gazette, outside sources also guided the direction
of this paper. One instance, as you will see below, is the time of year that the bubonic plague frequented certain areas of Egypt.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/dig-eg-gaz/dig-eg-gaz.github.io/blob/master/images/analysis-images/cyr-Plague-Pie-Chart.png?raw=true" alt="Types of Plague in Egypt in 1905" /></p>

<p>Fifteen percent of the word occurrences of ‘plague’ found within the Egyptian Gazette were
of other meaning than the actual Bubonic Plague that affected humans and warrant at least
some attention due to its involvement within the Gazette. Eleven percent of  these word
occurrences affected cattle and was thus termed: “Cattle Plague.” An article written by
W. Littlewood, M.R.C.V.S., chief veterinary inspector Sanitary Department, aptly titled,
‘<em>Cattle Plague in Egypt in 1903-0405</em>,’ The Journal of Comparative Pathology and Therapeutics,
1/1/1905, Volume: 18, Page 312-321, indicated that the cattle plague made entry into
Egypt as a result of trading with countries to the east and south:
“</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first (cattle plague) invasion of Africa during the last twenty years was undoubtedly
due to the introduction of cattle either from Arabia through Aden, or to shipments from
Bombay to Massowah in the winter of 1887 and 1888, during the war between Italy and
Abyssinia. From Massowah the disease rapidly spread  over Italian territory, and
thence to Abyssinia. We have no definite information as to whether the disease entered
the now Anglo-Egyptian Soudan at the time, but if such was the case the losses must have
been small, as there were large numbers of cattle in the Soudan when it was occupied by
the Anglo-Egyptian Forces a few years later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two more items of discussion before getting into the bubonic plague. 1) Words unrelated to the disease, as an example, mention the “plague of social evils in Cairo;” hence, the use of
this term is not relevant to the article, and 2) It is not entirely impossible, that with the lack of tools and modern information, that
some diseases may have been categorized as the bubonic plague as opposed to the flu, though
there is little evidence that has been shown that points to the contrary.</p>

<p>Some information about the bubonic plague, also known as, the Black Death. As noted in a previous post, the
bubonic plague was not confined
to Medieval Europe (as many readers would suspect). In fact, the Bubonic plague has existed
for thousands of years, the first known case being recorded in China dating back to 224 B.C.E..
The most significant outbreak, and most noticeable, occurred in Europe in the mid-fourteenth
century over a five year period (1347 to 1352). During this time period, sources indicate that
at least 25 million people died, about one-third of the continent’s population (these numbers
are disputed). The often disputed claims as to the cause of such a disease was further
investigated in 2010 and 2011, when researchers analyzed DNA from some of its European victims.
The consensus to date is that the pathogen responsible was the <strong>Yersinia pestis bacterium</strong> (shown below), which
most likely caused several different forms of the plague.
Seeing an outbreak within the borders of Egypt, with so few deaths was incredible, which warrants
further understanding of this disease (as well as bacterial resistance and natural selection), how it was spread and who it affected. The collaborative effort of students within this course have shown that the Egyptian Gazette mentioned
that a <em>minimum</em> of  39 cases were under investigation during the year of 1905. With the plague’s notorious reputation, the Gazette’s
allocated space to this pandemic is sapient, especially due to the many cattle deaths in the area
within that same time period.</p>

<p>As noted above, a minimum of 39 cases (85% of plague responses), usually involved multiple people that had
an incidence of bubonic plague. The problem with these numerous responses to the bubonic plague is they are a very short
summary of each occurrence, not giving much information on the statistics of those affected, just that they had either caught
the disease or died:</p>

<p>The summaries above were calculated and placed in the bar graph below in terms of location with regard to the plague:</p>

<p>If you have noticed the summaries above do not fully match the bar-graph below it.
It has been noticed that the ‘latest’ date of September the 4th indicates that between
January 1 and September 2 of 1905, there were <strong>246</strong> cases of plague have been reported
against 786 during the corresponding period of the previous year. This information says a few things,
1) There are 540 fewer cases reported in Egypt during the same time period in 1904, and 2) The Egyptian
Gazette only sporadically covered the events of the bubonic plague. So it is likely that the Gazette received the tally
of plague incidents from another source and is not in itself the main repository of this information. These figures then (the totals)
cannot be discounted entirely, rather, they can be compared with other institutions for accuracy.</p>

<h1 id="further-investigation-warranted">Further Investigation Warranted</h1>

<p>The quoted material below brings attention to the time of year that Egyptians receive incidents of the plague. An
effort to corroborate the information below was undertaken by adding up what information was accessible from each
student’s week of study. See line graph at bottom in conjunction with the ‘areas of plague’ bar graph above.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where the plague begins, northern or southern Egypt, seems to have effected the timing of the plague.
People feared plague that arrived from the south more than those that began in the Mediterranean ports.
Mr. Alan Mikhail
reports that plague in Upper Egypt (the south) ran from March to May, in mid-Egypt from April
to June, and in the delta and Mediterranean ports from May to October. The flea’s intolerance to the
climbing dry summer heat that travels from south to north over the late spring and summer accounts
for this rolling plague season. So if a plague begins in the south and travels north ahead of rising
summer temperatures, the death toll of the plague throughout Egypt will be much greater. If it starts
at a Mediterranean port and travels south, then we have two waves heading toward each other and the
summer heat ends the plague. Egyptians believed that risk of plague was over for the year by mid-June.
In 1791 the plague arrived in late winter, peaked in early spring, and dwindled by summer.
A fair amount has been written lately comparing epidemiology of the Black Death with the third pandemic
and other modern outbreaks. The shifting Egyptian plague season a good reminder of how important local
climate is to insect transmitted disease.
In conclusion,  Mikhail.. argues persuasively that plague was a regular enough feature of the Egyptian
environment that it should be considered as part of a cycle of environmental disaster that regularly
visited Egypt. Mikhail also reminds us of Egypt’s importance in the study of plague up to early modern times.
(Alan Mikhail, (2008). The Nature of Plague in Late Eighteenth-Century Egypt Bulletin of the History of Medicine,
82 (2), 249-275 DOI: 10.1353/bhm.0.0031)</p>

<p>Though there are some similarities with the results and the times of year mentioned by Mr. Mikhail, there needs to be more data
covering the entire year.</p>

<p>In conclusion, this is a great start for those that wish to learn more about the plague and how it has affected
Egypt as a whole. The times of year and areas feared by Egyptian citizens, namely the Mediterranean ports and ‘Upper’ Egypt could
have affected many areas of life, trade, travel and more. This information could then be considered when evaluating other specialties and trades.</p>

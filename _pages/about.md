Through close reading of the Egyptian Gazette, an English-language daily newspaper published in Alexandria, we will compile comprehensive data about local events during a single year, 1905. Each student will be responsible for one week (6 issues, totaling 40 pages) of the paper; together we will cover the year.

This class brings together 

* microhistory, 
* urban history, 
* Middle Eastern history, 
* media history,
* and digital history. 

It is suitable for those interested in

* history 
* Middle East studies 
* digital humanities
* computer science
* communications
* international studies
* history of journalism and advertising

No background in these fields is necessary, however.
	
We will gather this data using digital methods. Students will learn to use:

* microfilm
* photo stitching ([Microsoft Image Composite Editor](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/groups/ivm/ICE/))
* optical character recognition ([AABBY FineReader](http://finereader.abbyy.com/))
* project management ([Github](https://github.com/dig-eg-gaz))
* XML editor ([Oxygen](https://www.oxygenxml.com/))
* [Text Encoding Initiative](http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml) tags 
* name authority files ([Prosop](http://prosop.org/))
* mapping software ([Google Maps Engine](http://mapsengine.google.com/), [GOAD fire insurance maps 1905](http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/15525296?n=21&imagesize=1200&jp2Res=0.125&printThumbnails=no))

The class is composed of labs and workshops, not lectures.
	
We then work together to represent those events in a website that will employ a variety of digital communication tools. This website will present serial data and analysis concerning:

* local crime news
* international events 
* commodity prices
* shipping
* passenger arrivals and departures
* weather
* the stock market
* advertising
* sports scores
* science news

    and much, much more!

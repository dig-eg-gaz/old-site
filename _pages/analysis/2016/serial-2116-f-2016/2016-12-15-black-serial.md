Every issue of the Egyptian Gazette includes a **“CALENDAR OF THE WEEK”** section where it publishes events occurring in Alexandria and its surrounding areas. It serves as a tool to keep its citizens up-to-date with what is happening in the town and advises them to go and participate in these events. During the week of August 7th through the 12th, 1905, the calendar strays away from its typical listing of plays, concerts and general entertainment and lists actions the people should take rather than events they should attend. These actions include things like “Avoid eating onions and garlic”, “Drink cold water before breakfast”, and “Great abundance of watermelons”. This is where my interest for this section of the newspaper began. For my serial question I will be investigating the events/actions listed in this section throughout the entire year. I’m interested in seeing how these lines change and if there are any more *interesting* lines like the ones that appear between August 7th and the 12th.  I will be looking at one **“CALENDAR OF THE WEEK “** section per week since they don’t change frequently. I hope to find out if lines like the ones that appear here are jokes meant for readers’ entertainment or if they are supposed to be taken seriously.

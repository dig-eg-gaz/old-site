  For my serial question, I chose to explore the various concerts that seem to take place
  fairly regularly in Alexandria.  More specifically, I want to explore where each traveling
  band or orchestra comes from, as there seems to be many foreign concerts that come
  into town and play at restaurants or hotels.  I think it could be interesting to see how
  traveling music was in 1905, as compared to current musician's touring schedule.

<p>The Egyptian Gazette will occasionally feature a “Sport and Play.” section, usually containing scores from<br />
cricket games. For the majority of this week, though, the section featured a regatta hosted by the Khedival<br />
Yacht Club. Unlike cricket, a regatta is a series of boat races, so I initially found its placement<br />
in the newspaper odd, until reading this sub article:</p>

<p>Yachting has apparently found an audience in Alexandria’s sporting community, so much so that private owners with<br />
large money influences have begun to participate in races. (That is how I understand it at least.) I figured<br />
some additional research into these races was warranted:</p>

<p>1907 – <em>The Motor Boat: Devoted to All Types of Power Craft</em>, Volume 4, Issue 12, by Francis P. Prial<br />
pg. 43: Prial mentions the waters near Alexandria and in Egypt in general as “splendid facilities for motorboating…”  
and how these waters were not receiving enough attention from craft owners.</p>

<p>Although the central theme in this source is motorboats, not yachts, I feel the source warrants mentioning because<br />
ideal waters might be a reason for the success that yachting in Alexandria had seen, and because the author also speaks<br />
highly of the Khedival Yacht Club.</p>

<p>1908 – <em>Encyclopaedia of Ships and Shipping</em>, by Herbert B. Mason<br />
pg. 328: A general definition of the Khedival Yacht Club: “Established 1902. Patron, H. H. the Khedive of Egypt ;<br />
Commodore, H.H. Prince Aziz Pacha Hassan…Entrance fee, £3 ; annual subscription, £2.”</p>

<p>Based on the mention of an entrance fee, I assume that anyone could have participated in the regattas, and that the aforementioned<br />
private owners had the money to invest in elite crafts that could win races.</p>

<p>1907 – <em>Fore’n’aft</em>, Volume 11<br />
pg. 62: The Khedival Yacht Club is hailed as “the only important organization of its kind in Egypt…<br />
and now has two hundred and thirty members and a fleet of fifty yachts. Weekly regattas are held in fort and numerous<br />
enjoyable social functions at the handsome club house.”</p>

<p>To conclude, here are the results of the week in question’s regatta:</p>

<p>The Ananke, a privately owned craft favored by the newspaper to win the race in its class, could not withstand the wind and<br />
waters that day, and had to forfeit the race.</p>

It's almost the end of the semester and I am still on the second blog post, wow. At the beginning of the semester I had a big issue, my brand-new MacBook stopped working. At first they believed my trackpad and keyboard were not working because of a virus on my computer, they gave it back after deleting the virus and it went back to not working, after that I took it back and they worked on it for another week and believed they had fixed the problem, I got it back and a few days later I was still on the same page. The Apple technicians at the bookstore got to know my name very well as I had to keep going back. In the end my MacBook took about a month to get fully repaired, they ended up having to replace the whole keyboard, so obviously, I fell behind. Once I got it back I began to work deliberately on the material, although it is not difficult work, I would still find myself spending hours in front of my computer without much progress. So much correcting, so many things to fill in, plus handling four other classes at the same time, so stressful. Cisdem OCR helped me so much more than the ABBYY OCR, it could detect the print much more precisely which made the process a little easier.

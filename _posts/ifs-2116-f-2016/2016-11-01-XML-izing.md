I can't say that around fifty hours of work in Oxygen was what I expected when I signed up for this class, but it's certainly what I've been given. Work in Oxygen can be rewarding, tedious, and frustrating in one package, usually at the same time. While I have sympathies for my classmates who saw massive technical issues, I never
had anything that problematic when I was XML-izing my files.

The most difficult part of this class was largely typing most of my week by hand. FineReader's trial ran out on my desktop, and when I tried to download it on my Mac, I found that it didn't work anywhere near as well as it did on my desktop. So I would up typing the entirety of my week under my own manpower, rather than relying on AABBY.

Beyond that, it was a fairly methodical, sensible process. There were instances of annoyance, like when I would accidentally delete a div and the entire thing would collapse, but I'm pretty sure that part's past me now. I'm looking forward to going more in-depth into the Gazette.

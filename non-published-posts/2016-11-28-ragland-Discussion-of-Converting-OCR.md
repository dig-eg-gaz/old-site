My biggest problem with the entire process has been with the OCR process. Perhaps due to poor original scans, or perhaps due to poor images
from the source, I have had serious problems with my OCR coming out correctly. Unfortunately, I've had to manually type every page and it has
caused me countless headaches and more than one mental breakdown. Luckily, things got a bit smoother after finishing all my page 3's. That being
said, I'm still working extremely hard at catching up and finishing what I have to do.

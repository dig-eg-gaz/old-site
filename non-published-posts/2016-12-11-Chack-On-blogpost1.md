 The people of the Egypt or the Egyptian Gazette cover a broad range of topics covering day to day functions that benefit the people.

 However it has also been a hub for expressing foreign or neighboring military powers and the actions they are making.
 An interesting part of nearly all of the third pages in my week of the newspaper have featured either government or military leaders and their most up to date business.

 An example would be on the third page of June 9 issue where topics covered a British submarine sinking and the death of a prince. In comparison to the modern world where such information is a simple tap or click away this was most likely the quickest and cheapest way to stay informed about the powers that governed their world. Especially since everyday was a new paper it's almost safe to say that it was close to accurate to determine where ships are head or are currently located. Especially if such a power was nearby knowing about the government plans was also necessary. Businesses relied on the paper but the interesting things that were going on in the paper was always foreign relations and the day to day habits of those with influence. Government rules or maybe some command was sent out in order to deal with an issue so its safe to say the people relied on the government to solve certain issues.

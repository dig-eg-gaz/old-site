The *Egyptian Gazette*, a daily newspaper catering to English and French speaking residents of Alexandria, began publication in 1880. This website is product of a digital microhistory course at [Florida State University](fsu.edu), which will be offered for the first time in fall 2016. The aim of this course is to produce a digital version of the paper for the year 1905, including full structure and content markup. This website will present the content of the paper, and host student analysis of our findings.

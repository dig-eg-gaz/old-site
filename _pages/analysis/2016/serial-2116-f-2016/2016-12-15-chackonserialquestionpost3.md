An interesting bit about the week that I had in my newspaper was the bits about foreign affairs or generally the big powers that pertained to other nations. These nations would be Russia, the United States, France and Japan. A repeating pattern is how each week instead of talking about some other possibly closer or other crisis that is going on, the section of page 3 would always talk about one of the four nations that I spoke of earlier.
This begs for the question of how much did they bigger nations have on the people of Alexandria at the time. Considering that the rest of the newspaper is filled with other useful information for the average citizen, its interesting to think about why would the newspaper even include such stories about these nations. This would shed light on if these affairs affected their business or other relations such as sports and stock shares.

One such example is a sitting between Japan and Russia where they are having some sort of talk about learning Japanese peace conditions. Another article after that expressed how strict Russia is as they threw away a boats shipment because the papers were not proper and could have been because the Japanese were approaching. This article shows a clear concern of Russia at the time of war with Japan and trying to find a condition where both parties could reach a peaceful resolution.

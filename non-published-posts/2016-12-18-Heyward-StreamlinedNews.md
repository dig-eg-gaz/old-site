When reading the text in The Egyptian Gazette, many of the topics that are
discussed deal with the economic events of Egypt. A great amount of textâ€™s
subjects includes imports and exports, and trading throughout Egypt and the European economy.
All of the subjects that are discussed within the Egyptian Gazette hint at the
sorts of people who read the Egyptian Gazette at that time.
Though there is a Local and General column, the most detailed and prominent
sections throughout the Egyptian Gazette seemed to be the sections that
 discussed the economy, political happenings throughout Egypt and Europe, and the lives of people within royalty.
This is of interest to me because today, though all of these topics in the
Egyptian Gazette are talked about in the news and in media today, the content of
 today seems a lot less streamlined. The topics in the Egyptian Gazette seem to
 be intended for a more educated audience.
Today in America, I feel that I could not say the same for the bulk of the
prominent news that circulates. This is fascinating to me
because it suggests how people of that time in Alexandria and Cairo lived their
lives. It also shows how information was circulated, what information was
circulated, and suggests who it was circulated to.

<p>I’ll admit, this has been a tasking adventure into the unknown world of
MicroHistory. This class has introduced to me: <a href="">Microfilms</a>, XML Coding
and the how to use systems such as ATOM, Github, FineReader and Oxygen
XML Editor. I felt as if I was tech savvy before, but this class has
taught me how wrong I was about that. I’ve been certified in the basics
such as word, excel, powerpoint, photoshop and indesign. This class
broadened my sight on what computers are capable of. This class taught
me a whole new level From converting Film into Microfilm screenshot,
to text, to XML coding has been a task; but it’s an achievable one. I’ll
admit, the time consumption of these processes is large. It can take
over an hour to convert each page to text and then another hour to convert
the text to XML code.</p>

<p>Github is also a difficult program to work with. This is most likely
because I have not ever used a program like it. I am slowly getting the
hang of the program but I still love to check to make sure everything
goes through correctly. This class is a very interesting class because
it has shown me a whole new way to look through History. The technical
aspect of the class is difficult, but the challenge is well worth it.</p>

In all my work in this class thus far there has been one thing stick out to me the absolute most, that is, Oxygen XML Editor is God's gift to everyone in this class. Without the amazing program known as Oxygen this class would have undoubtedly been the most difficult class just because of the sheer amount of coding that is involved. Not difficult coding, just a lot of it; and with oxygen that work was made twice as easy if not more just by its accesibility and workability. Our of all the programs used in this class, which is my favorite part about it, Oxygen has become my favorite for its help in detection of errors and its ease of finding and fixing the errors given.

Wihtout oxygen I am not sure if I would have been able to complete my assignments for this class in time, and i know that they would not have been nearly accurate or formed corerctly. It would have been a horror scene of errors and unclosed divs.  Thank you Professor Hanley for providing us the knowledge to use Oxygen, it has saved me countless time and energy.

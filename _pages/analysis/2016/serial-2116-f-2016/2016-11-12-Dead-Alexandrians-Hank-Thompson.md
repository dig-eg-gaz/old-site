My serial question is rather simple, I want to see how many deaths occurred in Alexandria during the year of 1905. I want to compare demographics, causes of deaths, location and from this compile a map, to the best of my ability to display this information. This map would be relatively simple; it would obviously be a map of the city corresponding to that time period with dots marking as many of the local deaths as I can manage. To help compare the causes of death, I have developed a system to differentiate the points, with red being for murder/manslaughter, green and black for disease, blue for drowning, and white for accidents. While this system is bare bones and might very well be refined as I proceed, it is the basic idea of categorization I wanted to convey.

I noticed while working on the paper that death was treated as more common place and matter of fact than what we are used to today, and decided it might be worth talking about and mapping. For instance, the paper reported on the [collapse of a house and the death of all its occupants](https://dig-eg-gaz.github.io/curiosities/building-collapse-hank-thompson/) only once, and while I have not seen anything else about collapsing structures in Alexandria, I wondered if perhaps poor building practices might be involved. Its possible as I search through the papers I might find more collapses that claim people lives and from there might be able to hypothesize about infrastructural problems that might have been facing Alexandria.
By examining the local deaths of Alexandria, not only will I hopefully be able to build a rather interesting map, I might also be able to examine some problems that the city might have been facing below the surface.

<p>My serial discovery is that of reported military naval movements, particularly the movements of the Russian and Japanese fleets as a result of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Russo-Japanese-War">Russo-Japanse War</a>. My goal is to use key words such as: “navy, battle, combat, fleet, ship, military, Nebogatoff, Tago and Rodjestvensky”, to find entries in the year of 1905. After finding as many entries as possible from the Egyptian Gazette, I will put together a spreadsheet that lists the report type (civilian or official), date, location and affiliation of each fleet.</p>

<p>Hopefully, there will be additional information like the admiral(s) present with each fleet, the number, names and types of ships and any losses if a battle has occurred. Any information that is lacking in the newspaper can hopefully be supplemented by <a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/russian-fleet-surrenders-at-port-arthur">outside historical records</a>. After collecting and organizing the data, I plan on using Google maps to plot the location and movements of the fleets, which will then be tagged with all of the non-locational data. That way, there will be a spiderweb across a map of the oceans linking points that can be clicked on for all available information on what happened there.</p>

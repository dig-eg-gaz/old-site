For my serial question for this course, I would like to find out who the fastest horse in all of Alexandria during the year of 1905. The topic sparked my interest while I was coding the xml for my page threes. I am fascinated by sports and I noticed that there were reoccurring articles regarding horse racing and bets taking place around the races.

The manner in which I plan to go about doing my analysis for my final project is querying the entirety of the Gazette for keywords like "horse" and "race" and "odds". This will help me find what I am looking for in order to compile data to see who the most victorious race horse was. It would be very interesting to find the Secretariat of the early 20th century.

Hopefully, I will not run into any other problems for the remainder of this troublesome course. It has been quite difficult to complete basically every single portion of the work, and I am glad to be nearing completion of the class.

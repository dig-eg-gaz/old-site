I am working backwards, having written the paper and then attempting to formulate
a serial question that would enrich the information obtained.

The serial question would be piggy-backing off of an article found that was written by Alan Mikhail in 2008 regarding the plague
in Eighteenth century Egypt:

>Where the plague begins, northern or southern Egypt, seems to have effected the timing of the plague.
People feared plague that arrived from the south more than those that began in the Mediterranean ports.
Mr. Alan Mikhail
reports that plague in Upper Egypt (the south) ran from March to May, in mid-Egypt from April
to June, and in the delta and Mediterranean ports from May to October. The flea’s intolerance to the
climbing dry summer heat that travels from south to north over the late spring and summer accounts
for this rolling plague season. So if a plague begins in the south and travels north ahead of rising
summer temperatures, the death toll of the plague throughout Egypt will be much greater. If it starts
at a Mediterranean port and travels south, then we have two waves heading toward each other and the
summer heat ends the plague. Egyptians believed that risk of plague was over for the year by mid-June.
In 1791 the plague arrived in late winter, peaked in early spring, and dwindled by summer.
A fair amount has been written lately comparing epidemiology of the Black Death with the third pandemic
and other modern outbreaks. The shifting Egyptian plague season a good reminder of how important local
climate is to insect transmitted disease.
In conclusion,  Mikhail.. argues persuasively that plague was a regular enough feature of the Egyptian
environment that it should be considered as part of a cycle of environmental disaster that regularly
visited Egypt. Mikhail also reminds us of Egypt’s importance in the study of plague up to early modern times.

82 (2), 249-275 DOI: 10.1353/bhm.0.0031)

The serial questions (three simple question) for analysis would the be:
1. What are all the incidents of plague in the year 1905 (each students week)?
2. Where were these incidents reported?  
3. What time of year?
Some information has been used and charted, but a more accurate assessment is still needed.

The answer to these questions could then be better analyzed and charted to see if the information
above is accurate.

The only issue at this point is getting the information. A search found scattered information for any
given month and only nine months out of the 12.
- Information has come from: January, February, April, May, June, July, August, September, and October.

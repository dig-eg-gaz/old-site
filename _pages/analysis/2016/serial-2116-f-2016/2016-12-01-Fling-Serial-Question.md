In my week of the Gazette I came across a Ship that caught
on fire. This report was found on page 3 of November 25, 1905.
The ship was full of cotton and rice when it was
set aflame. Flames were not visible but smoke was pouring
out from the vessel. The smoke calmed due to incessant pumping
for about 2 hours. But soon after the ship fire seemed to be
controlled, the smoke bursted forth again.
2 hours later, it was decided that the ship was to be put
ashore, on the bank in hopes that the hold would fill with
water to subdue the fire. This did the trick and finally
calmed the fire upon the ship.
Oddly, the cause of the fire is reported as,
"unknown."

This section of the newspaper seems to report the most
severe of fires. I am curious, as to what the other weeks of the
Egyptian Gazette will have to offer about such fires. My serial
question for the 1905 Egyptian Gazette will be: How often did
the Egyptian Gazette report Fires in 1905? I will also be researching
why these fires occurred. In this instance, the cause of the Fire is
known. I wonder if the Gazette often list the cause to these fires
as known.

This stuff is harder than it looks.

Like most of the people in this class, I have came across a formidable amount of problems while trying to do basically every step of this project. When I first began scanning my images for OCR, the first two columns of each of my page threes were blurred out so I had to go back to the library to re-scan the images more times than seemed necessary. To add to the latter, the _AABBY_ software was not the best at recognizing the characters, ergo, it was a long and gruesome process to correct all of the errors. Formatting the edited text into TEI was quite difficult as well due to the fact that this is my first time working with code. Had this class been offered for more than one semester, it may have been feasible to accomplish everything listed in the syllabus.

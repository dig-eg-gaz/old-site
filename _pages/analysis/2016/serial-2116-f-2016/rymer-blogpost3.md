The Egyptian Gazette provided a huge amount of information on Egyptianss from over
one hundred years ago.  Much of this information revolves on local business at the
time, financial information, shipping routes, and other high level historical
information. My interest is in the average experience of the everyday person. The
easiest way to gain that insight is by measuring entertainment options againist
each other to find out what the average Egyptian is most interested in.  My serial
question will direct my focus on exactly that.

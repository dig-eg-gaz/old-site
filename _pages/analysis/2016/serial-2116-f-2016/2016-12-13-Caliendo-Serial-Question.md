My serial question comes as a result of many hours of trial and error with various search queries. Before I decided on my serial question, I figured I would play around with different search queries in Xpath in order to familiarize myself with that specific feature of Oxygen. Although it was a little difficult and confusing at first, I soon got the the hang of things and suddenly, ```//div[@type="item"]``` became my favorite query.

For some reason, after a semester of working with *The Egyptian Gazette*, my interest in societal views on cigarettes and tobacco increased tenfold. So, I decide that for my analysis project, I would query The Gazette as a way to research cigarette culture and society standing in Alexandria, Egypt in 1905. Furthermore, I will use this research as a tool to understand the contrast in societal views on cigarettes between the early 20th century, and 2016. My serial question is this: *What was smoking culture like in 1905 Alexandria?*

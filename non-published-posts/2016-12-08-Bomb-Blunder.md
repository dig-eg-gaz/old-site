For this assignment, I decided to begin my search in the third pages of every
issue.  I figured that out of all of the pages, filled to the brim with boring trade
information and ship arrival and departure times, these pages would definitely
contain the most personal and vibrant reportings. They were directly from the
citizens themselves for the most part. To my surprise, this was not the case.

On my third issue of the week, the seventeenth of May, I found a very
startling report, I even read it back twice to make sure my eyes weren't failing
me but there it was in clear text, "Discovery of a bomb factory."  How in the
world could have this possibly made third page news? It should have been the
headline of the entire gazette.  And this was no simple discovery, there were
bombs being thrown at police resulting in two deaths.  There were bombs being
found in different towns as well.  This is a very big deal, I will never understand
how this was not made a bigger part of that day's issue.  I will never
understand how they only made two remarks about it, totaling less than five
sentences.  If a bomb factory was discovered where I lived and people were killed,
especially men of the police force, I would want it to be front page news.
I would want details of the memorial and information on the assailants.
But i guess the painstaking details of the mail schedule and cigarette ads are
way more deserving of the public eye.

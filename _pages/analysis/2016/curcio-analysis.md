While searching for a serial question to embark on, I really wanted to be drawn
to the patterns of trade or mail lines maybe even exciting expeditions.  But
I noticed one aspect of each issue that always caught my attention, the medical
miracles.  I would see personal accounts of Egyptian citizens telling their
seemingly hopeless stories.  "Severe rheumatism," "kidney trouble," and "poor
appetite," were just some of the bed confining ailments that were all suddenly
cured by a magic box of pills.  And these stories weren't just present in my issues.
I found them scattered throughout the whole year.  The question I will be
investigating is how successful really were these pills? I will be
researching how many cases of medical success resulted from the Doan's Backache
Kidney Pills in particular, over the course of this year.  I will also go into
further studies of the proclaimed brand and gain more historical and background
knowledge of its origins and the pill's chemical makeup.  I hope to conclude
how successful of a brand this really was and determine if it was as miraculous
as the people of Egypt claim.

I began my research by trying to gain a more conclusive background of the
brand.  Was it more natural or synthetic? What was the main ingredient? By
sifting through countless pages I finally found my answer within the newspaper
itself.   Apparently Doan's Backache Kidney Pills were a more natural remedy
than anything else.  The medicine had been used by the Quakers for 72 years,
comprised of "roots" and "herbs."  The pill acts as a stimulant to the kidneys,
naturally aiding the filtration blood, and the flushing of surplus water and
impurities in the blood stream.  Even more specifically, the pills catalyze the
dissolving process of crystallise I poisons.  This can in turn cure, "Bright's
Disease, dropsy, rheumatism, urinary disorders, gravel, gall stones, sciatica,
lumbago, weak heart, and diabetes," or so the brand claims, I have attached proof
of these claims in the following images.

I however decided to conduct my own personal research.  I did find that they
were indeed comprised of natural ingredients,"purely vegetable" to be exact.  I
discovered this through a reliable web source, detailing the pill's wrapper
information and directions for use.  I have provided a chart listing the
pill's components and the source from which obtained can be found in my works
cited.

![ingredients](https://github.com/dig-eg-gaz/dig-eg-gaz.github.io/blob/master/images/analysis-images/curcio-ingredients.png?raw=true)

I then decided to turn my attention back to the newspaper.  Knowing that
these pills were actually what they claimed to be, just how many cases of success
were reported?  And what did they all have in common?  I began to search for a
pattern.  There were fourteen total features of the Doan's Backache Kidney Pills.
A few of the advertisements were purely informational.  Including facts about the
drug and symptoms it could treat.  The others were actual patient accounts.  I
organized these based upon which condition or conditions they suffered from and
claimed to have  been cured.  I then organized this into the following chart.

![conditions cured](https://github.com/dig-eg-gaz/dig-eg-gaz.github.io/blob/master/images/analysis-images/curcio-conditions-cured.png?raw=true)

The results were astonishing.  The drug did in fact treat a wide variety of
diseases that it claimed to have.  One of the most prevalent being kidney disease
which is a very serious condition.  I decided to research all of the diseases
that patients claimed to have been cured from, and compare them to modern ways of
treatment, I made several breakthroughs with this method.

Kidney disease cannot be treated by medication alone, it can ease symptoms
by providing much needed vitamins, but it cannot actually cure kidney disease
which is what these subjects claimed.  Nowadays the only real cure is dialysis or
kidney transplantation, anything else is just a cover up for the real issues at hand,
only treating the symptoms and not the problem.  Below I have included all of the
cases of supposedly cured kidney disease within the issues and next to that I have
included up to date information from a reliable medical source.

![kidney disease](https://github.com/dig-eg-gaz/dig-eg-gaz.github.io/blob/master/images/analysis-images/curcio-kidney-disease.png?raw=true)

Rheumatism, unlike kidney disease can be treated with medication.  There is
no cure for this disease but anti-inflammatory drugs can make an unbelievable
difference and ease joint pain greatly, so it is very likely that sufferers of
this condition were actually assisted by Doan's Backache Kidney Pills.  Again I
have included all of the cases of cured Rheumatism within the issues and next to
that I have included up to date information from a reliable medical source.

![rheumatism](https://github.com/dig-eg-gaz/dig-eg-gaz.github.io/blob/master/images/analysis-images/curcio-rheumatism.png?raw=true)

Bright's Disease was another claimed ailment supposedly cured by these pills.
Bright's Disease is currently treated on a case by case basis because each
underlying cause of disease is very different and there could be a wide range of
causes for each unique person.  However, it is greatly possible that the Doan's
Backache Kidney Pills did indeed assist in relieving symptoms in some cases,
if the cause was inflammation of the kidneys and nothing else.  So these claims
are not discounted.  I included all of the cases of cured Bright's Disease within
the issues and next to that I have included up to date information from a
reliable medical source.

![brights disease](https://github.com/dig-eg-gaz/dig-eg-gaz.github.io/blob/master/images/analysis-images/curcio-brights-disease.png?raw=true)

Next was dropsy, currently known as edema.  This is swelling caused by
excess fluid trapped inside your tissues.  It was proven that this ailment can
in fact be treated by simple diuretics, just like Doan's Backache Kidney Pills
so I have concluded that all of these patient claims are valid.  Again, I
included all of the cases of cured dropsy within the issues and next to that I
have included up to date information from a reliable medical source.

![dropsy](https://github.com/dig-eg-gaz/dig-eg-gaz.github.io/blob/master/images/analysis-images/curcio-dropsy.png?raw=true)

Individuals also claimed that their loss of appetite was somehow regained
after taking the pills.  Upon research, this was the most difficult to conclude.
Loss of appetite can stem from many things, a majority of them being
psychological.  But many cases occur because of bacteria, viruses, and severe
medical conditions, including kidney failure.  These pills had the capability of
strengthening the kidneys so it is possible that if the source of the problem
was kidney functioning the pills may have been helpful in treating loss of
appetite.  I can conclude that these patient claims were in fact valid.  I
included all of the cases cured of loss of appetite within the issues and next to
that I have included up to date information from a reliable medical source.

![appetite](https://github.com/dig-eg-gaz/dig-eg-gaz.github.io/blob/master/images/analysis-images/curcio-appetite.png?raw=true)

Back pain was one of the last conditions that was claimed to have been
cured by these pills.  Just as Bright's Disease, it is diagnosed on an
individual basis by doctors and treated accordingly.  But medications have been
proven useful if they contain anti-inflammatory agents.  Therefore I have to
render all claims of cured back pain from Doan's Backache Kidney Pills reliable.
I included all of the cases of cured back pain within the issues and next to that I
have included up to date information from a reliable medical source.

![back pain](https://github.com/dig-eg-gaz/dig-eg-gaz.github.io/blob/master/images/analysis-images/curcio-back-pain.png?raw=true)

Lastly was urethral stricture, this is the narrowing of the urethra which
restricts urinary flow.  Modern research suggests that medication is of no
assistance in treating the disease.  It can only be cured surgically by physically
removing the blockage.  Therefore, the claim made for urethral stricture being
cured by Doan's Kidney and Backache Pills must be discounted.  I included all of
the cases of cured back pain within the issues and next to that I have included
up to date information from a reliable medical source.

![strictures](https://github.com/dig-eg-gaz/dig-eg-gaz.github.io/blob/master/images/analysis-images/curcio-strictures.png?raw=true)

My final conclusion is that Doan's Backache and Kidney Pills were
undoubtedly effective.  However they were not as miraculous as they claimed to be.
They were not the cure for kidney disease and they could not have been curative
for urethral strictures.  And not to mention there were diseases they said they
could cure that were never even mentioned by patients, throughout the whole year.
If the pills really did cure severe conditions, like diabetes and weak heart, I
would think the public would be inclined to speak out and I believe these cures
would still be acknowledged and practiced today, but they are not.  I do think
this drug provided much needed relief for many people suffering from things like
back pain, loss of appetite, rheumatism, dropsy, and very specific cases of
Bright's Disease.  And that in and of itself is remarkable, especially for a natural
drug, one sold over the counter, and one of this time period.  The Doan's brand
is still around today and sold at local drugstores, it still acts as an anti-
inflammatory drug and has extremely high ratings from users.  The only conditions
they claim to cure nowadays is joint stiffness, swelling and pain.  I really do
believe that this was an extraordinary brand, maybe not capable of medical
miracles but certainly capable of relief.

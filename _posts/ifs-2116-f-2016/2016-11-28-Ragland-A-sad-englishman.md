A rather unfortunate English soldier was captured by an employee of a Turkish tobacco company who sent one of his ears to the Consul at Monastir, ordering a ransom be paid for him.  Interestingly enough, this tobacco company is still around today--in a sense.  The company was the Ottoman Empire’s largest foreign investment.  It was called “Tekel” in 1825, but is actually still called “Regie” in Lebanon.  I found it interesting that the company selling Lebanese tobacco is the same company which cut off an English soldier’s ear way back in 1905.

When thinking of a Serial question to pose, I ran into a lot of problems. It was incredibly difficult to find a topic that interested me that also had data to work with. Because of the inconsistencies present in the encoding effort, I decided to look more broadly at certain section of the paper, and I finally found one that I could work with: Letters to the Editor.

After some X-Path querying, starting with looking for just common words in the header, such as "editor" or "free discussion". This resulted in too many items that were not relevant to the item I was looking for, so I narrowed it down to the exact headline listed in the paper. As expected this resulted in a much more accurate query, giving me direct links to the items I wanted to analyze. However, I noticed after looking through certain days that some had decided to put the header of this item into their "p"-tags or placed them into "sections" rather than "items", which means I was missing these items (or they were lost in a mass of text that was too much to sift through). After taking this into account, I believe I will have a large enough sample of these letters that I can start getting "raw numbers" from them.

At the conclusion of this I want to answer questions: Is there certain type of "letter" that the editor of the Egyptian Gazette choose to put out on display in their newspaper? Do they want to want to promote "free discussion", or do they have a certain crowd to please or narrative to push?

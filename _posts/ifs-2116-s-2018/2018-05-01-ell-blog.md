Captain Charlton, who is an Assistant Military Secretary to the Sirdar, married Gwendoline Whitaker. Her gown was white lace and chiffon and had a white satin Court train, she wore a tulle veil and a wreath of orange blossoms and myrtle. A dress made of those same materials today is worth at least $400 depending on the style. If the dress cost $400 dollars it would convert to 7,045 Egyptian Pounds. While doing some research I found out that Princess Royal Victoria also wore a wreath of orange blossoms and myrtle in 1858. It was very popular in the 1800â€™s, Princess Alexandra of Denmark, Princess Helena and Princess Alice also wore one in their wedding. She also had a diamond crescent and bow brooch with aquamarine and pearl pendant. These were also very popular accessories in the mid 1800s.

In the modern world advertising can target individuals based on their web traffic; that is, the advance of modern technology has revolutionized advertising as advertising has allowed modern technology to develop into what's available today.

[Advertising](https://github.com/dig-eg-gaz/advertisements/tree/master/ad-images) in the Egyptian Gazette did exist under the same technological climate; instead, the only form of targeting these advertisements had available was to target the general audience of the publication.

So what do these advertisements reveal about the audience?  What kinds of places where they interested in?  What were they interested in buying--or what did advertisers try to sell to them?  What words appeared most frequently?  What companies advertised most frequently?

I want to analyze the content of the advertising in the Egyptian Gazette with the intention of discovering something interesting about their audience.

[Entire Books](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=q8tUSCDORzwC&oi=fnd&pg=PA47&dq=advertising+and+culture&ots=B_X0Pax0q2&sig=vBolxbkOS8wKUkoDVSneDxl63Gg#v=onepage&q=advertising%20and%20culture&f=false) exist on this topic.  The digital format of the Egyptian Gazette lends itself particularly well to extracting data from the TEI indexed, digitized pages for the year; using [data](https://d3js.org/), I hope to create some useful [visualizations](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1044242).

So the process of getting this newspaper into proper xml has been no easy feat for any single person I know that has attempted it. While an overall useful set of information that has been digitized for future benefit, it is quite apparent that the work involved in doing so is tedious to say the least. To start off is the OCR that initially reads the newspaper which creates a number of issues right off the bat. No matter how high quality the image you got with the scanner there will always be spelling errors everywhere. This doesn't mean that the program is terrible in any way, however when reading an old newspaper that has obstacles that throw said program off it is an issue to correct. Thankfully the program has a dictionary and a replace all feature to take down the amount of errors in the text that OCR has made. Afterwards turning the text into xml is the most time consuming out of this process. Thankfully the program Oxygen editor has a myriad of useful shortcuts and abilities that help going about adding tags and what not to the text.

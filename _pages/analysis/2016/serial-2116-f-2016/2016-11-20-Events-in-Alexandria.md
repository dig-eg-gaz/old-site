One of the most important aspects of culture is the method in which people who share this culture are united. This method of uniting people can be either through language, like in Germany where the dialects are of the utmost importance, or through sports like the Mayan civilizations. I intend to determine the most common public event in Alexandria, in an attempt to gain insight into that which united the people of Alexandria, Egypt even though they were of varying social class and nationality. I plan on discovering the most common public event in the area by collecting information from all of the calendars in the paper and making a full calendar of events for 1905. From there, I'm going to analyze the proportions of events listed and the type of events. From there, I'll be able to determine the most popular public event in Alexandria, assuming that events that occur more often would be so because they are popular among the people. If the event occurs often, insinuating it's popular among the people, then it must be at least part of what brings the people together. Thus, while the answer to "what united the people of Alexandria" may be much harder to answer than that which can be found via a simple search of one year of a newspaper, simply determining which events occurred most often could provide a useful beginning to developing the whole of the answer to that much larger question.

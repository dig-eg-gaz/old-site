During the early 19th century, the last thing civilization needed was a plague epidemic, especially involving a disease of pure evil from cows. Thatâ€™s right, cattle plague! Also known as Rinderpest, cattle plague caused human death when in contact with cows carrying a disease from disturbing origins. Usually, cattle has always been a popular animal in markets and trading systems; providing us with meat, dairy, and my personal favorite of glorious cheese products. However, cattle has let us down in society when cattle plague was spreading rapidly, and causing mortality rates to increase. I chose this topic as my serial question because originally, my curiosity was peaked towards medical approaches to plague epidemics. As I continued my research, Cattle Plague was mentioned several instance in the Digital Gazette, and I wanted to know more about who it affected, and how drastic were the changes or conditions. I am still currently researching to prepare for my individual project, finding out more about immunity to cattle plague, consequences to the aftermath of cattle plague, and the disease itself found in both cattle and carried on to human beings. No, cows are not evil. They are peaceful creatures, however, cattle plague ended many lives unintentionally, and leading to an epidemic of deadly fevers.

For my serial question I would like to investigate the lack of reporting on a widespread plague that is spreading through Egypt and taking lives. I have noticed in my section newspaper that there is currently a plague going on and it seems to me by the article lengths that are getting written about it that the Egyptian gazette doesn’t really care. Recently when ebola and other diseases have ravaged the US in a way, big newspapers like the New York Times or the Washington Post have written very large pieces on the disease and on efforts to stop it. I would like to look into how devastating the diseases has been to the area as well as how far it has spread. I would like to also find out if other newspapers at the time were reporting on it or not. The goal is to see if there was an alternative motive behind the Egyptian gazette’s lack of reporting on the plague spreading through Egypt.

The way I will go about this is by looking at all the deaths in Alexandria in the year and seeing the causes. Also I will see any other types of illnesses and diseases that might have been going around in the year 1905. Also I will look at outside sources to see if the Egyptian gazette was under reporting this plague.
